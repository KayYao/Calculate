    The Fixed Problem.
        1.) The panel of calculate2 and calculate can match the frame.
              The order can't be changed. If you changed the  order, the panel can't be match the frame.
              	SetSizer(sizer1); //use the sizer for layout
                sizer1->Fit(this); //fit the sizer to the content
                sizer1->SetSizeHints(this); //set hintd to honor min size
                
       2.) Fixed the when the augend is zero, it can't calculate the addition.
               if(this->m_nCurNum==0)
               {
		  this->m_nPrevNum=this->m_nPrevNum;
                }
       3.) Fixed the dec transform.
